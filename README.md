# Cinemaster

Movie ticket system for a college project.

The system presents multiple windows in which you will be able to:
1- Select a movie
2- Select a showtime
3- Choose a seat

The movie theater has 50% discounts on Wednesdays and Thursdays and each cinema (or movie hall) has VIP seats at the back (the furthest away from the screen).

P.S: Pardon the spanglish, I had to code this in spanish for college, I'll create a new branch with an English translation when I get the chance.
